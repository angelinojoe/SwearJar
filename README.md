# SwearJar

SwearJar is a chrome extension that acts as your own private swear jar that lives in your browser. 
By adding event listeners to input fields on every page you visit, SwearJar then checks against a swear dictionary and 
gives you an alert if you swore. When it's time to cash out, choose the charity to donate that amount to and be directed to their donate
page. When you absolutely must swear, click the "it's urgent' button and your swears won't add to the jar, just choose "I'm ready to
behave again" when you're ready to watch your language again. 

This project is a Work in Progress, more features to come!
